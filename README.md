# **Know Your Rights **

## Context**

**Know Your Rights** provides accessible, clear, and reliable information about individuals' legal rights when interacting with law enforcement. It users understand what to do if they are detained or questioned by police, ICE, or other authorities.

### **Why We Built This**
Inspired by the **Hack(H)er 413 Diversity Panel**, we reflected on the role of technology in promoting justice and inclusion. The panel sparked crucial questions for us:  
- How can we create technology that protects people, not power structures?  
- Can we design systems to prioritize fairness and inclusivity?  
- How do we make complex legal information simple and accessible for everyone?

**Legal knowledge should be clear, actionable, and accessible for all** ‚Äîespecially for marginalized communities who may face biases in law enforcement interactions.

- **Help Now**: Redirects to the **SOS Page** for tailored, scenario-based guidance.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Profile Setup Page (profile.html)**  
Users can input **optional demographic details**‚Äîsuch as **age, gender, immigration status, disability, race, and religion**‚Äîto receive more relevant, personalized advice.  
- **Opt-Out Option**: Users can choose not to provide this information if they feel uncomfortable.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **SOS Page (sos.html)**
