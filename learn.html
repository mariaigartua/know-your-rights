                    <li><strong>Recording the Encounter:</strong> In many places, you have the right to record police interactions, but ensure you do not interfere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example Scenario:</strong> If pulled over, keep hands visible, provide license and registration, and ask if you are free to go. If not, ask for a reason and remain calm.</li>
